Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

* _Navigate to the folder where the repository was cloned and run the index.html file using your Chrome/Mozilla browser_

## GAME PLAY
===============================

* Everytime the user loads the game 3 bugs would start running across
   the screen at varying speeds :smile: .

* You , "The Hero" :running: , would be at the center of the action trying to reach 
   the pond at the other end battling with the your enemy, THE BUG !! :bug:

* To avoid the bugs use the UP key :arrow_up: to JUMP one step forward
                                   :arrow_down: to move back one step
                                   :arrow_right: :arrow_left: 
                                   Left and Right arrow keys to dodge the Bugs

* Suppose you are HIT :collision: by a BUG :bug: then the game resets and you are back to your starting position :rage: :disappointed:
* If you are victorious :heartbeat: then enjoy the game again by Hitting the Replay Button :repeat: 

## Hope you enjoy the Game !!
